Just rendered bad apple using python in ascii

You can either run the computation live (but its going to be offsync) or you can pre-compute all the frames into a text file
then it can run smoothly at the cost of some storage, im still not sure how to sync it properly without pre-computing

also you can choose whether you want to invert the frames or not
